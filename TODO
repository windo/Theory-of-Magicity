Stuff to do, in order:
 * a working set of fields and balls
 * a (tutorial) level with a story
 * sound effects
  * each field has a sound effect (or both positive and negative), volume determined by field strength
 * visual effects
  * background images
  * each field has them
 * music
 * title screen

Ideas:
 * ball actions
  * merge/split - when low tension, forces not opposing
  * release/acquire - always
  * movement/shape - always
 * field effects
  * force vs speed?
   * speed - time multiplier
   * force - added constant
  * left-right direction?
  * vision?
   * no - wrong - ok - duplicate - farther
   * light/darkness?
  * damage multiplier?
  * stats
   * health
   * movement
   * energy
 * no ball pictures, each field draws their own effects?
 * language
  * magic can be written in a language, spells written and read
  * magic casters (NPCs) can be scripted
 * (massively ;) multiplayer world
  * gods/cabals in a round world
  * each god/cabal has a limited number of items of special power
   * the god distributes the items to followers to do his bidding
   * the shrine must be protected (source if items' power)
   * the opposing side of magic must be conquered
 * very good programmer's documentation of the game
