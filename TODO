Stuff to do, in order:
 * Particle system
  * Particle energy consumption from Actor (only support so many particles at once without them dissipating)
  * Particle energy control (hot<->cold)
 * speeds per time(), not per frame
 * (tutorial) level with a story
 * magic language, spells
 * no balls as such, each field draws their own effects?
