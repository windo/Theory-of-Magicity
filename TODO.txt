Stuff to do, in order:
 * finish Siege story
  * run, get help, get back, fight, secure position
  * focus on: big battle, speed
 * controls improvement
  * implement mouse control (for balls)
 * further camera improvements - less switching during turing
  * not so jumpy
  * delayed speed estimation?
  * following actor + controlled ball(s)?
 * sound effects
  * creature sounds
   * should not be so lowsy
  * each field/ball has a sound effect
 * implement "visual" magic

Ideas:
 * balls
  * merge/split - when low tension, forces not opposing
  * release/acquire - always
  * movement/shape - always
   * not just the normal distribution
  * combinations of different fields
 * field effects
  * force vs speed?
   * speed - time multiplier
   * force - added constant
  * left-right direction?
  * vision?
   * no - wrong - ok - duplicate - farther
   * light/darkness?
  * damage multiplier?
  * stats
   * health
   * movement
   * energy
 * language
  * magic can be written in a language, spells written and read
  * magic casters (NPCs) can be scripted
 * (massively ;) multiplayer world
  * gods/cabals in a round world
  * each god/cabal has a limited number of items of special power
   * the god distributes the items to followers to do his bidding
   * the shrine must be protected (source if items' power)
   * the opposing side of magic must be conquered
 * very good programmer's documentation of the game
