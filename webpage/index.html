<h3>Theory of Magicity</h3>
<p>"Theory of Magicity" is an experimental game made for an university course. The core idea is to treat magic as a physics-like system rather than a set of canned spells. So instead of having a "haste" spell that doubles a character's speed, this game has a "magic field" (analogous to gravity in real world) that affects how fast (or slow) a character can move.</p>
<p>The latest release of the game boasts:</p>
<ul>
<li/><b>Fun for the whole family!</b>
<li/>Physics-like magic system (three magic effects)
<li/>Three increasingly difficult (but short) levels with <u>storyline</u>
<li/>Super-fancy visual particle effects
<li/>Two original music tracks
<li/>Mediocre graphics
<li/>Lowsy sound effects
<li/><blink>Appalling web site!</blink>
</ul>
